# Using CU Research Computing in Data Curation 

Publication of research datasets is now a requirement of most funding agencies and journals. Data curation is the process of ensuring that these datasets are findable, accessible, and usable. In the era of Big Data, the generation of datasets with sizes on the order of 100s of gigabytes and larger is increasingly common. Such large datasets create challenges for both the curation and publishing of data as they often cannot be accessed on standard computer hardware or hosted in traditional online repositories. This presentation provides an overview of a collaborative process between the CU Boulder Libraries and CU Boulder Research Computing in which high-performance computing infrastructure is used to curate and publish gigabyte- and terabyte-scale datasets in a manner that makes them accessible to the research community.
